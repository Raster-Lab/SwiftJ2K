# SwiftJ2K

JPEG 2000 and HTJ2K for the **Swift Image Compression Suite**.

**Status: Milestones 2 to 5 executed on the owner's assignment; a 12.1.0 release preparation passed every gate, but the owner deferred the release until the migration of J2KSwift is complete (HTJ2K, Part 1 breadth, containers, acceleration, JP3D, JPIP and CLI breadth remain; programme in [IMPLEMENTATION.md](IMPLEMENTATION.md)). No release exists.** The library encodes and decodes lossless JPEG 2000 Part 1 codestreams for the shared profile: unsigned greyscale, 1–16 bits in 16-bit storage, reversible 5/3 wavelet, raw codestream. Decoding covers the full Part 1 greyscale lossless syntax (any tiles, origins, layers, code-block styles, progression orders, precincts, tile-parts); encoding writes one tile, one layer, default style. The `swiftj2k-cli` executable encodes, decodes, inspects and validates. HTJ2K, lossy coding, colour, containers, acceleration and native transcoding are not implemented. The intended first stable library version is **12.1.0**; it is not a published release, and contract 0.9.0's continuous-integration precondition is still unmet. The package has no dependencies, and its capabilities advertise exactly the coverage above. Evidence: [MILESTONE2.md](Documentation/MILESTONE2.md), [MILESTONE3.md](Documentation/MILESTONE3.md), [MILESTONE4.md](Documentation/MILESTONE4.md), [MILESTONE5.md](Documentation/MILESTONE5.md); release procedure: [RELEASE.md](Documentation/RELEASE.md).

SwiftJ2K is the standalone successor to [J2KSwift](https://github.com/Raster-Lab/J2KSwift). The successor is intended to provide a harmonised API, explicit memory ownership, high-precision sample preservation and efficient shared-storage integration. It has no mandatory dependency on another suite library or CompressionFamily. Apache-2.0 licensing applies to these documents and subsequent authorised in-house implementation; third-party material retains its own terms.

## Migrating an existing application

Read [MIGRATION.md — J2KSwift to SwiftJ2K](MIGRATION.md) for dependency/product and API mappings, sample ownership, feature gaps, staged cutover and rollback instructions for people and coding agents. Current migration can prepare application adapters; real codec replacement must wait for qualified successor functionality.

## Swift 6.4 development candidate

Version: **12.1.0** ([VERSION](VERSION)), the target of the first stable; shared contract **0.10.0**. The stable tag is cut by the release procedure in [Documentation/RELEASE.md](Documentation/RELEASE.md) after the migration programme completes; see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). See the [current qualification record](Documentation/Engineering/OS27CLI/README.md) for adopted features, exact Xcode/Swift Build evidence and open platform gates. The historical [Milestone 1 evidence](Documentation/MILESTONE1.md) remains unchanged.

## Intended platform baseline

Swift 6.2 manifest minimum with Swift 6.4 as the qualified primary toolchain, Swift 6 language mode and complete concurrency checking. Apple OS deployment minima: macOS, iOS/iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS and watchOS 26.0. Apple Silicon is the primary optimisation target. macOS x86_64 and Linux ARM64/x86_64 are included with cleanly separated platform/architecture support. Ubuntu 24.04 is the initial Linux engineering baseline. These are requirements, not completed qualification claims.

## Start reading

Milestone 1 established the API and memory contract with synthetic buffers ([evidence](Documentation/MILESTONE1.md)). Milestone 2 migrated the scalar lossless JPEG 2000 path from the pinned predecessor and validated it against OpenJPEG and Kakadu ([evidence and open gates](Documentation/MILESTONE2.md), [file-level provenance](HISTORY.md)). Milestone 3 proved the required-sharing decode-into and encode-from path with instrumentation, mutation testing and the contract harness ([evidence](Documentation/MILESTONE3.md)); its JPEG-LS leg waits for a SwiftJLS encoder. Milestone 4 extended decoding to tiles, origins, layers, every code-block style and progression order, and wired the CLI ([evidence](Documentation/MILESTONE4.md)). Milestone 5 prepared the release: URL-based consumption, the migration guide and its executable example, licence and fixture notices, Swift 6.4, sanitizer, SBOM, fuzz and Apple SDK gates ([evidence](Documentation/MILESTONE5.md)). Use the task prompts in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Native in-memory transcoding

Planned standalone **lossless J2K ↔ HTJ2K transcoding** keeps intermediate coefficients or a shared uncompressed image in memory. Both directions preserve samples and required interpretation; original compressed bytes may differ. The predecessor contains a transcoder, but source review found correctness shortcuts that must be corrected and independently tested. See [transcoding instructions and source-review findings](TRANSCODING.md) for the API/CLI pattern, limits and acceptance tests. This remains planned successor functionality.

## Relationship to the suite

The four independent libraries are SwiftJ2K, SwiftJLS, SwiftJXL and SwiftJLI, all intended to live under Raster-Lab. A future optional umbrella adapts them for codec selection and in-process transcoding. The codecs do not depend on that umbrella. SwiftCompressionFamily is not part of this successor plan. The common contract is mirrored documentation plus behavioural tests, not a shared runtime package.

The main module is `SwiftJ2K`; `swiftj2k-cli` is the executable. A [compiled independent consumer](Examples/Consumer) and the [migration example](Examples/MigrationExample) demonstrate the current API. Features from the predecessor are migration candidates whose exact coverage must be verified; see IMPLEMENTATION.md. Nothing here changes the predecessor repository's current maintenance configuration.

## Command-line help and manual

The `swiftj2k-cli` executable encodes, decodes, inspects and validates lossless greyscale JPEG 2000 codestreams through the contract's NRRD interchange profile, with pipes, atomic output, JSON reports and the full exit-status map; `transcode` stays reserved. Verbosity has five levels: `-v`, `-vv`, `--verbose 1..5`, `--verbose=+++` and `-verbose: 3`; diagnostics use stderr and `--quiet` suppresses optional messages. See [CLI usage and installation](CLI.md). The installer updates both the executable and its UNIX man page together. [OS 27/CLI qualification](Documentation/Engineering/OS27CLI/README.md) supersedes the earlier OS 26 upgrade decision; earlier evidence remains historical.
