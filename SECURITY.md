# Security policy and implementation requirements

Status: release preparation (Milestone 5). No successor stable release or tag exists yet and no vulnerability response time is promised here. The supported-version policy below takes effect with the first stable tag.

## Reporting

Use the repository's private vulnerability reporting option in its Security tab if it is enabled. Otherwise use an established private channel to a Raster-Lab organisation owner to arrange disclosure. Do not post exploitable payloads, credentials or patient information in a public issue. This document does not assert that GitHub private reporting or a dedicated security mailbox has already been configured.

Include affected version/commit, platform, a minimal safe reproducer, expected/actual behaviour and impact. Use synthetic data where possible.

Checked on 22 September 2026 through the GitHub API: private vulnerability reporting is **not enabled** on Raster-Lab/SwiftJ2K, and Dependabot security updates, secret scanning and push protection are disabled. Enabling private reporting is an organisation-owner action that this repository's maintainers cannot perform from a pull request; it is listed as a release precondition in [Documentation/RELEASE.md](Documentation/RELEASE.md). Until it is enabled, use the private channel above.

## Supported versions

| Version | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `12.1.x` (first stable line, not yet tagged) | Will receive correctness and security fixes on `main`, released as patch versions, from the `12.1.0` tag onwards |
| `12.1.0-dev.*` development identifiers | No support; each is superseded by the next commit on `main` |
| Predecessor J2KSwift | Maintenance window under contract revision 0.8.0 item 6: security and correctness fixes only, in the predecessor repository, until its last in-house consumer has moved |

A report against an unsupported version is still welcome; it will be reproduced on `main` first.

## Threat model

Treat every compressed image, metadata field, interchange header and caller-supplied descriptor as untrusted. Attackers may attempt out-of-bounds access, integer overflow, decompression bombs, pathological entropy work, deeply nested containers, unbounded tasks/caches, malformed colour profiles, unsafe external references or leakage of previous frame memory. Core codecs do not access the network, spawn reference codecs or interpret embedded code.

Enforce the resource, deadline and ownership rules in the common contracts before allocating and while processing. Check slice indices and offset bases. Bound metadata, frame/component/tile counts and parse depth. Reject unsupported essential features. Do not use assertions/preconditions to validate hostile input. Do not emit success after partial decode or cancellation.

Use synthetic fixtures and sanitised diagnostics. Do not log raw images, patient fields, full filesystem paths or memory addresses by default. Initialise exported padding and prevent pool reuse while readers remain. Use scoped filesystem operations only in the CLI; reject detached input references/URLs in the initial stream profile. Atomic final-output publication and overwrite checks must not become path traversal or symlink vulnerabilities.

## Required verification

Run parser/descriptor mutation tests, bounded fuzzing, address/race checks on supported environments and allocation/cancellation stress. Record and fix crash/hang seeds. Review unsafe bridges and native kernels. Check third-party development tools/dependencies and pin reproducible versions. No unresolved severe memory-safety, data-corruption or input-triggered denial-of-service finding is acceptable at stable release.

Correctness and security gates cannot be waived by a benchmark improvement. See `Documentation/TESTING.md` and `Documentation/PERFORMANCE.md` for evidence requirements.
